# Game Development - Project #5 - A cat through ages - the game
Fifth and the final project for Game Development course. <br/>
The game aims to be placed in a natural museum and consists of 4 separate smaller mini-games which show the evolution of cats throughout the history. At the same time, the game types evolve as well, meaning that the first one is supposed to remind old retro-style 2D, while the last one is modern 3D-styled.<br/>
Everything is done in Unity and uses C# for scripting.<br/><br/>
